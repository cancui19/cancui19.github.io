I am a Research Scientist in Vision-Language Action (VLA) Models at the <a href="https://www.bosch-ai.com/" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/logo/bosch_logo.png" alt="Bosch Logo" style="height:25px;vertical-align:middle;"> Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI)</a>, developing foundation models for personalized, interpretable, and safe autonomous driving. My prior industry experience includes serving as an AI Research Intern at <a href="https://amrd.toyota.com/division/itl/" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img/logo/Toyota-Logo-1978.png" alt="Toyota Logo" style="height:25px;vertical-align:middle;">Toyota InfoTech Labs</a> and as a Controls Research Intern at <a href="https://www.cummins.com/" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img/logo/Cummins-logo.png" alt="Cummins Logo" style="height:20px;vertical-align:middle;">Cummins Inc\.</a>, developing control algorithms and digital twin validation for physical systems. I earned my Ph.D. from <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/logo/purdue_icon.png" alt="Purdue Logo" style="height:20px;vertical-align:middle;"> Purdue University</a>, advised by Dr. [Ziran Wang](https://ziranw.github.io/), where my research focused on human–autonomy teaming, multimodal perception, and digital twin–based validation for autonomous vehicles. My work spans LLMs/VLMs, VLA, human-autonomy teaming, generative motion planning, control, and data-driven autonomy.

<!-- I am currently a second-year PhD student at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/),
[Digital Twin Lab](https://purduedigitaltwin.github.io/), advised by Dr. [Ziran Wang](https://ziranw.github.io/). Before joining Purdue Engineering,
I received my Master's degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/)
from [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), and I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Automotive Engineering at Wuhan University of Technology. My research interests include applied AI/ML, perception, motion planning, Large Language Models, motion controls, and digital twins. -->

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can
put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by
editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will
render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to
use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,
Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
