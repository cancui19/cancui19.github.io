I am currently a first-year PhD student at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/),
[Digital Twin Lab](https://purduedigitaltwin.github.io/), where I serve as a graduate research
assistant under the guidance of [Prof. Ziran Wang](https://ziranw.github.io/). Prior to joining Purdue,
I earned my Master's degree in [Computer Science](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html)
from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). My research interests include applied AI/ML, autonomous vehicles, and
digital twins.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can
put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by
editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will
render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to
use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,
Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
