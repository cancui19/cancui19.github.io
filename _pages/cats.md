My two beloved companions go by the names Dusty Bun and Suzie Poo. They came my world in May 2022, and since then, they have become an integral part of my life here in the United States. No matter how late I return home, they are always waiting for me, just like loyal family members. Every moment spent with them brings me immense joy and comfort.

To help you decode the enigmatic world of my cats, here's a little cheat sheet with some quirky tidbits about them:

    ---
    Names:
        Dusty Bun (Brother)
        Suzie Poo (Sister)
        Damien (The youngest)
    Species:
        Cats (and part-time comedians)
    Birthday:
        All three are May babies, born in 2022.
    Morning Routine:
        Suzie Poo: The instant I open my eyes, she appears as if summoned—ready to socialize.
        Dusty Bun: Prefers to stay asleep and ignore morning responsibilities.
        Damien: Arrives once he confirms I’m truly awake and capable of serving a purpose.
    Favorite Hobby:
        Dusty Bun: Eating and sleeping. Simple, elegant priorities.
        Suzie Poo: Seeking human attention and winning hearts effortlessly.
        Damien: Trying (and trying again) to get Dusty and Suzie to play (Even Suzie and Dusty hate that).
    Personal Space:
        Suzie Poo: Wherever I am—that is her designated personal space.
        Dusty Bun: Claims the sofa as his sovereign territory.
        Damien: Splits his time between the stool and the bed.
    Bedtime Routine
        After finishing their evening canned food, they each head to their favorite resting spots and call it a night—quietly, efficiently, and without further negotiation.

<!-- 
The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div> -->
<!-- ``` -->
{% endraw %}
